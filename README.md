# CoverCollector
A high-performance, minimalist web interface for searching and collecting uncompressed, high-quality physical album artwork variants.

## Live Demo
The project is available via the [Live Demo](http://covercollector-env.eba-ffenptyp.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/) hosted with AWS.

## Features
* **Real-Time Reloads:** Results are fetched and displayed without refreshing the tab.

* **Image Scaling**: Converts standard thumbnail links into LQ (500x500) and HQ (3000x3000) dimensions through the iTunes API.

* **Simple Layout**: Separate searchbars for artists and albums, fixed boxes for images of varying sizes, and a dark theme to reduce eye strain.

* **Lightweight Architecture**: No heavy frameworks, external libraries or complex databases to install/configure.
